A python software ive written back in the days.
A gtk daemon that connects to your phone via 
bluetooth and warns you with a popup when a
call arrives or when the battery level is low.
Ive tested it with a Nokia 5230 (RIP) and a Nokia
6680, nokia ftw :D
Brought to life in this summer nite (16/06/10), 3 
years later.
A new revision may come soon, stay tuned :D
